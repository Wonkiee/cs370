Work done:
Added syscalls mygetpid, steal, quad, and swipe as described on the project assignment page.  All implementations containted in kernel/sched.c with additional changes in arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S and include/asm-x86/unistd_32.h to tie them into the system.
written 4 programs 
testSysCall.c  testSteal.c testQuad.c  testSwipe.c
to test mygetpid, steal, quad, and swipe respectively.

To Run
apply the patch proj2.diff, and recompile kernel
compile each test progam using gcc 
gcc -I **path to the patched source include directory** filename.c

testSysCall takes no arguments
testSteal takes 1 argument, the pid of the process whose timeslice you want to steal
testQuad takes 1 argument, the pid of the process whose timeslice you want to quadrouple
testSwipe takes 2 arguments, the pid of the process you want to increas the timeslice, and the pid of the process you want to remove the timeslice, respectively.
